    <h1 class="green">Vuetify</h1>
    <p align="justify">Vuetify is a complete UI framework that is based on Vue.js and complies with the Material Design (MD) specification. This means that the core functions of both Vue and Material are available by default and can be improved by both communities. The goal is to provide developers with tools to create rich and engaging designs and user experiences. Vuetify is easy to learn and provides hundreds of carefully crafted components from the MD specification. It supports all modern browsers and is compatible with Vue CLI-3. It also provides basic templates for Simple HTML, Webpack, NUXT, PWA, Electron, A La Carte, Apache Cordova.</p>
    <br/>
    <p align="justify">Of course, that also means that you have to take on the MD with Vuetify. If you develop an app exclusively for IOS or have to rely completely on your own design, Vuetify is not the right decision. So also with Vuetify the rule remains the same: first analyze the requirements of the project, then select the UI framework.</p>
